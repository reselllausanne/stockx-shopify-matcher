## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash

### Configuration

#### 1. Create `.env.local` file

Create a file named `.env.local` in the root directory with your Shopify credentials:

```bash
# Shopify Admin API Configuration
SHOPIFY_SHOP_DOMAIN=your-shop.myshopify.com
SHOPIFY_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN=shpat_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
SHOPIFY_API_VERSION=2024-01
```

#### 2. Get Shopify Admin Access Token

1. Go to your Shopify Admin → Settings → Apps and sales channels
2. Click "Develop apps"
3. Create a new app or select existing
4. Configure Admin API scopes: `read_orders`, `read_products`
5. Install app and copy the Admin API access token
6. Copy your store domain (e.g., `my-store.myshopify.com`)

### Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Usage

### Supplier Orders

1. **Enter Your Token**: Paste your Supplier Bearer token in the password field
2. **Save Token** (Optional): Toggle "Save token locally" to persist it in localStorage
3. **Customize Query** (Optional): Edit the GraphQL query or variables as needed
4. **Fetch Data**:
   - Click "Fetch First Page" to load orders

### Shopify Matching

1. **Load Supplier Orders First**: Make sure you have Supplier orders loaded
2. **Click "Load Shopify Orders (30d)"**: Fetches recent Shopify paid orders
3. **Review Matches**: See automatic matching suggestions with confidence scores
4. **Verify Matches**: Check SKU, size, date, and product name alignment
5. **Manual Override**: Edit the Supplier order number field if needed
6. **Color Coding**:
   - 🟢 Green border: High confidence match (name+size+time<48h)
   - 🔵 Blue border: Medium confidence match (name+size+time<4d)
   - 🟡 Yellow border: Over 4-day threshold (needs review)
   - 🟣 Purple border: Liquidation product (manual match only)
   - ⚪ Gray border: No match found
   
## Matching Logic

See [MATCHING_LOGIC.md](MATCHING_LOGIC.md) for detailed explanation of:
- Hard filters (product name + size required)
- Scoring algorithm (time proximity as main differentiator)
- Exclusions (Fear of God, liquidation products)
- Special cases (LEGO, duplicate prevention)
- Examples with scores

## API Route

The app includes a proxy API route at `/api/stockx` that:
- Validates the Bearer token
- Forwards requests to the supplier API
- Sets proper headers (authorization, origin, referer)
- Returns the upstream response with proper status codes
- Never logs tokens for security

## Safety Features

- Token is never logged or exposed
- 400 error if token is missing
- Clear UI indication for 401/403 auth errors
- 250ms delay between pages when fetching all
- localStorage is only used if explicitly enabled

## Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
